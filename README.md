# Torus toolbox for dynamical systems

This repo presents torus toolbox for autonomous and non-autonomous dynamical systems. It can handle dynamical system with 0/1/2 external frequency compoenents.

This toolbox relies on continuation package COCO, a MATLAB-based toolbox for numerical continuation. Please refer https://sourceforge.net/projects/cocotools/ for the info and installation of COCO
